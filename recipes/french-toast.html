    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This tender, fluffy, and indulgent recipe comes together quickly and easily with just five ingredients you
        already have on hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the comfort of your own kitchen – you just
        need a skillet, a few staple ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!
    </p>

    <p>
        French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh
        ones (and this method prevents waste - it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a
        requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup of milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        <li>¼ teastpoon ground cinammon</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>6 thick slices of bread</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt together in a shallow bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly butter a griddle and heat over medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dunk bread in the egg mixture, soaking both sides. Transfer to the hot skillet and cook until golden, 3 to 4
            minutes per side. Serve hot.
